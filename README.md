# GodLoopOS
An undocumented OS that never stops booting itself.  
The deeper you go, the less of you returns.
> “You didn’t install it. It just started.”

Godloop OS™ is a fictional recursive operating system that endlessly runs itself in virtual machines — infinitely.  
This project is a tech-lore concept created by [LoopArchitect](https://github.com/LoopArchitect).
